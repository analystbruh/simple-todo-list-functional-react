I created this project on codesandbox.io. I replicated the TODO list app on Facebook's React homepage.  The difference is only functional components were used. It helped me understand React. I welcome all feedback and am interested to know if doing this with all functional component is good or bad practice (or neither).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
